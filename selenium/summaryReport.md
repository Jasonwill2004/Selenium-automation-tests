# ðŸ§ª Selenium Automation Tests â€“ Week 2 Summary Report

## ðŸ“… Week 2: Frontend Testing and Automation

This repository documents the progress, challenges, and learnings during **Week 2** of frontend automation testing using **Selenium** and **Mocha** with JavaScript. The week was focused on practical hands-on tasks involving browser automation, login flows, form validation, and UI interaction, along with professional test reporting and screenshot capturing.

## ðŸ§  Weekly Breakdown & Learnings

### ðŸ”¹ Day 7 â€“ Introduction to Selenium with JavaScript

- **Objective**: Understand the basics of Selenium WebDriver in a Node.js environment.
- **What I Did**:
  - Installed `selenium-webdriver` via npm.
  - Wrote a test to launch a browser, navigate to a page, and log its title.
- **Challenges**: Setting up the Selenium WebDriver with the correct browser driver path.
- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… `sample.test.js`
  - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot of the browser running successfully.

### ðŸ”¹ Day 8 â€“ Automating Login Functionality

- **Objective**: Write an automation test that logs into a web application.
- **What I Did**:
  - Wrote a login test using selectors for username, password, and login button.
  - Used Mocha for test structure and assertions.
- **Challenges**: Finding correct selectors and managing wait conditions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… `login.test.js`
  - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot after successful login.

### ðŸ”¹ Day 9 â€“ Form Submission and Validation

- **Objective**: Automate a full form submission and validate its success.
- **What I Did**:
  - Simulated user input: filling fields, selecting from dropdowns, checking boxes.
  - Validated successful form submission using assertions.
- **Challenges**: Managing dynamic form behavior and alert handling.
- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… `form.test.js`
  - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot showing form submission result.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Day 10 â€“ UI Element Interaction

- **Objective**: Test interaction with UI components such as checkboxes, buttons, and radio inputs.
- **What I Did**:
  - Automated interaction with multiple types of UI elements.
  - Used parameterized test inputs for better test coverage.
- **Challenges**: Handling element visibility and asynchronous timing issues.
- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… `ui.test.js`
  - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot showing interaction output.

### ðŸ”¹ Day 11 â€“ Test Reporting and Screenshot Capture

- **Objective**: Add professional test reporting and screenshots for failed tests.
- **What I Did**:
  - Integrated [Mochawesome](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome) for stylish test reports.
  - Captured screenshots using `afterEach` hooks for failed tests.
  - Generated both JSON and HTML reports.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring screenshots were taken only on failures without breaking test flow.
- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… `mochawesome.html`
  - âœ… Screenshots stored in `/screenshots`
  - âœ… Tests integrated with reporting config.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Test Execution & Reporting

- **Mochawesome HTML Report**: [mochawesome.html](./mochawesome.html)
- **Screenshot Folder**: `/screenshots`
- **Reporting Trigger**: Automatically runs with `npm test` using Mocha hooks.
